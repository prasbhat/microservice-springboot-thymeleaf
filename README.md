# mvc-springboot-thymeleaf
A simple project to show the Spring Boot with Thymeleaf in action.

Creating MVC architecture using Spring boot and Thymeleaf.

**Thymeleaf** is a Java template engine for processing and creating HTML5, XML, JavaScript, CSS, and text. It is able to apply a set of transformations to template files in order to display data and/or text produced by your applications.

The library is extremely extensible and its natural templating capability ensures templates can be prototyped without a back-end â€“ which makes development very fast when compared with other popular template engines such as JSP.

Thymeleaf has a good integration with Spring MVC framework making it first choice library for frontend development in Java and Spring technologies.

## Technologies used
- Spring Boot
- Spring Boot Thymeleaf Starter Pack
